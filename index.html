                    <h5>Butterfly Stretch (Baddha Konasana):</h5>
                    <p>Sit on the floor, bring the soles of your feet together, and let your knees fall out to the sides. Hold your feet with your hands. Gently press your knees towards the floor, either with your hands or by leaning forward from your hips (keeping your back straight). <strong>Focus:</strong> Inner thighs (adductors) and hip external rotation.</p>
                    <h5>Figure Four Stretch / Supine Pigeon Pose:</h5>
                    <p>Lie on your back with knees bent, feet flat on the floor. Cross your right ankle over your left knee. Reach through the gap and grab the back of your left thigh (or shin if you can reach) and gently pull your left knee towards your chest. Keep your right foot flexed to protect your knee. Repeat on the other side. <strong>Focus:</strong> Hip external rotation (targeting glutes and piriformis).</p>
                    <h5>Low Lunge (Anjaneyasana):</h5>
                    <p>Start in a kneeling position. Step your right foot forward between your hands, so your knee is directly above your ankle. Slide your left knee back until you feel a stretch in the front of your left hip (hip flexor). Keep your spine long. You can place your hands on your front knee, on the floor, or raise them overhead. Repeat on the other side. <strong>Focus:</strong> Hip flexor flexibility.</p>
                    <h5>Clamshells:</h5>
                    <p>Lie on your side, knees bent at a 90-degree angle, and feet stacked. Keep your feet together and lift your top knee towards the ceiling. Slowly lower it back down. <strong>Focus:</strong> Hip abductors and external rotators (gluteus medius).</p>
                    <h5>Glute Bridges:</h5>
                    <p>Lie on your back with knees bent, feet flat on the floor, hip-width apart. Lift your hips off the floor until your body forms a straight line from shoulders to knees. Squeeze your glutes at the top. Slowly lower back down. <strong>Focus:</strong> Glutes and core.</p>

                    <h5>Side-Lying Leg Lifts:</h5>
                    <p>Lie on your side, legs stacked and straight. Lift your top leg straight up towards the ceiling, leading with your heel. Slowly lower back down. <strong>Focus:</strong> Hip abductors.</p>

                <h3>Weeks 7-8: Consolidation and Maintenance Preparation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stretches:</strong> Continue all previous stretches, aiming for your comfortable maximum. Increase hold times to 45-60 seconds, 3 repetitions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Strengthening:</strong> Maintain all strengthening exercises, potentially increasing repetitions or sets.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sitting Practice:</strong> 8-15+ minutes. Gradually try reducing props under your knees, observing if your knees remain lower. Continue using hip elevation as needed for spinal comfort.</li>

                <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Consistency over Intensity:</strong> A little bit often is much better than a lot once in a while.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mind-Body Connection:</strong> Pay attention to how your body feels. Breathe into the stretches.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use Props:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Cushions/Folded Blankets under hips:</strong> Elevating your hips helps to tilt your pelvis forward, making it easier to maintain a straight spine and allowing your knees to drop lower. This is crucial!</li>
                            <li><strong>Cushions/Blocks under knees:</strong> If your knees are very high, placing cushions or blocks under them provides support and can help release tension, preventing overstretching of the inner thighs initially.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Everyday Movement:</strong> Incorporate more squatting, lunging, and hip-opening movements into your daily life.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stay Hydrated:</strong> Good hydration helps with tissue elasticity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Be Patient:</strong> Flexibility gains are slow. Celebrate small improvements. You might notice your knees dropping a few degrees, or you can sit for longer without discomfort.</li>
                </ul>
